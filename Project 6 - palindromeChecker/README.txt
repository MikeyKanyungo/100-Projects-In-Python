Challenge: Palindrome Check

Write a Python function called is_palindrome(s) that takes a string s as input and returns True if s is a palindrome, and False otherwise.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

For example:

is_palindrome("racecar") should return True because "racecar" is a palindrome.
is_palindrome("hello") should return False because "hello" is not a palindrome.
You can ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization when checking for palindromes.

Bonus: Try to implement a solution that doesn't require creating a reversed copy of the string.
