This Python program is a basic phone book manager that allows users to input and manage a list of names and corresponding phone numbers. 
Users can enter the number of entries they want to add, and then input the name and phone number for each entry. 
The program displays the entered data in a tabular format with columns for names and phone numbers. 
Users can also search for a specific name in the phone book, and the program will display the corresponding phone number if the name is found. 
The program stores the data in a dictionary and provides an option to save the data to a JSON file for future use. 
This simple utility helps users keep track of contact information in a user-friendly manner.
